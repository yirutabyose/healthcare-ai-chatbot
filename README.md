# AI Chatbot for Early Disease Diagnosis

## 🚀 Project Overview
Early disease diagnosis is crucial, especially in regions with limited healthcare access. This AI-powered chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to provide instant preliminary diagnoses based on user-reported symptoms. By analyzing inputs, the chatbot suggests possible conditions, encouraging early medical intervention.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Millions of people delay seeking medical attention due to limited access to healthcare, leading to severe complications and increased mortality rates. This project aims to bridge the gap by providing a **smart, AI-driven healthcare assistant** capable of analyzing symptoms and offering preliminary diagnoses.
